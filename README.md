# Flash Cards

A Node/React app to create and study flashcards by @Alexander, @BDMartinez, @hans

## Description:

Our app allows users to improve their knowledge of any topic by creating decks of flashcards, organized by the subjects they want to study.

For example, you could create a deck about the React Component Lifecycle, then add cards for each step in the lifecycle. Opening the deck to review would show you your cards, shuffled and one by one, to review.

Once you've created a deck, you can make it public for other users of the app to view. You can also add other user's decks to your collection.
